Based on your input, I've created a weekly plan that focuses on physical therapy and cognitive exercises, with an emphasis on Game Data Plan (none-motor rehab exercises). Since we don't have specific information on Age, Gender, Body Parts Impacted, and Stroke Cause, the plan is designed to be general and adaptable to your individual needs.
